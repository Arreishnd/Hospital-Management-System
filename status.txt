i am in the minute 25
i already wrote the dao and model classes.
we need to work in the web/patientServlet class which i prob will write it tmrw 4/5/2022. 

issues:
we have to setup our won server using mysql and idk how is going to work, so we prob gonna need to do some investigation to make it work since 
the video doesnt talk much about it on who to set it up. 

ToDo:
*do the patientServelt class and modify it for our tastes
*include the sort and search algorithms in the DAO class
